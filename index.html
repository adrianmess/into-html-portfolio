            <p><strong>About Me:</strong><br><br> Welcome to my portfolio. This is the first website i've created while attending epicodus. I recently decided to change career path's and felt like software development was the best thing for me to persue. I was an IT System Administrator for many years and worked in helpdesk before that. I've also wanted to learn how to code but I always felt like it was out of reach so I just kept doing what came easy to me. Even though my previous career came easy to me I was often bored. I felt like I wasn't pushing myself hard enough and that i wasn't using my creative side nearly as much as i would like to. This past year the opportunity for me to go to a coding camp became a reality after i sold my house. And even though I had the best job i've ever had and worked with people that treated each other like family, i knew i needed to move on. It was really hard to leave my job and to make the decision to move to another city to persue my dreams, but I know it's worth it. I'm excited to see how much I can learn while at epicodus.

         <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
          <p>This portfolio was initially created as our week 1 project. I couldn't think of where i would actually use the <em>&lt;EM&gt;</em> tag so I created another section where i could put the tags i couldn't find a use for.</p>
          <p>I will admit i didn't quite grasp how the &lt;ul&gt;,&lt;ol&gt;, &lt;il&gt; tags really worked until i had to use them again for this project.</p>
          <h3>Tags required for this project</h3>
